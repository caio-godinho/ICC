In C programming, a struct (or structure) is a collection of variables (can be of different types) under a single name.

Here's how we create structure variables:

struct Person
{
    char name[50];
    int citNo;
    float salary;
};

int main()
{
    struct Person person1, person2, p[20];
    return 0;
}

        *OR*

struct Person {
    char name[50];
    int citNo;
    float salary;
} person1, person2, p[20];


There are two types of operators used for accessing members of a structure.
    . - Member operator
    -> - Structure pointer operator

Suppose, you want to access the salary of person2. Here's how you can do it:
    person2.salary
